# delete [![NPM version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/delete.svg?style=flat)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/delete) [![NPM downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/delete.svg?style=flat)](https://npmjs.org/package/delete) [![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/jonschlinkert/delete.svg?style=flat)](https://travis-ci.org/jonschlinkert/delete)

Delete files and folders and any intermediate directories if they exist (sync and async).

## Install

Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```sh
$ npm install delete --save
```

## Usage

```js
var del = require('delete');

// async
del(['foo/*.js'], function(err) {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log('done!');
});

// sync
del.sync(['foo/*.js']);

// promise
del.promise(['foo/*.js'])
  .then(function() {
    //=> do stuff
  });
```

## Options

All methods take an `options` object as the second argument.

### options.force

_(The `force` option was inspired by [grunt](http://gruntjs.com/).)_

An error is thrown if you try to delete files outside of the current working directory (cwd).

Override the default behavior:

```js
del.sync('../foo.md', {force: true});
```
